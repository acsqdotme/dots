# √Ångel's dotfiles and scripts

This is my home directory as a git repo with just my config files not 
gitignored. This harebrained scheme comes from the inventor of harelang 
[himself](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html).

## todo:

* add zshrc
* make auto install script
* reorganize vimrc
* make custom nvim conf
* make /bin folder for scripts
* eventually make this zsh/bash/ash ambiguous
